# Janky Output Channels

Output channels are a little, well... janky! They don't even have color for extension logs, but the built-in ones do, so let's share the love!

## Inspiration

This extension is primarily aimed at extension developers like myself who might appreciate some color in their lives while looking at their extensions' logs.

## Features

### Colorization

Previously, the "Log" output channels like "Log (Main)" would get to enjoy the benefits of syntax colors to make them more readable while extension output channels suffered in monotonous monotones.

Now all extension channels also get to enjoy having multi-colored lives! For even better results, they should follow a format similar to the built-in logs.

This uses the `Log` language, which can also be seen in `*.log` files.
