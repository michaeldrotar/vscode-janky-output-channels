# Janky Output Channels

Output channels are a little, well... janky! They don't even have color for extension logs, but the built-in ones do, so let's share the love!

## Features

### Colorization

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
